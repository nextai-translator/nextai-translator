Clip translation is the killer feature of this software. For browser plugins, the browser provides a simple API to get the selected text, but for desktop applications, there is no unified API for each operating system to get the selected text.

Usually the clipboard is used to get the selected text, but this can cause bugs such as clipboard clutter in some applications and a warning sound in macOS because the cmd+c shortcut is pressed without the text selected. Fortunately, there are many mature clip software for various operating systems and they have a good plug-in mechanism, so NextAI Translator has developed plug-ins for these clip software to allow users to use paddleboarding translation painlessly.
