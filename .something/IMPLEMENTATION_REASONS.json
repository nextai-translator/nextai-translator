  "implementation_approach": {
    "version_strategy": {
      "decision": "Use semver ranges (^2.0.0) instead of exact versions (=2.0.0)",
      "reasoning": [
        "Allows automatic patch version updates (2.0.x) which contain bug fixes and security patches",
        "Follows Node.js ecosystem best practices for dependency management",
        "Reduces maintenance burden by not requiring manual updates for patch releases",
        "Prevents dependency conflicts when other packages depend on Tauri with compatible ranges",
        "Cargo will still use exact versions via Cargo.lock, ensuring reproducible builds"
      ],
      "trade_offs": [
        "Pro: Automatic security fixes and bug patches",
        "Pro: Better compatibility with the broader ecosystem",

        "Con: Requires periodic testing to ensure patches don't introduce regressions"

    "plugin_migration_strategy": {
      "decision": "Migrate all plugins from git dependencies to stable registry versions",
      "reasoning": [
        "Git dependencies are development/pre-release artifacts, not suitable for production",
        "Registry versions (npm/crates.io) provide versioned, immutable packages with checksums",
        "Improves build reproducibility across different machines and CI/CD environments",
        "Eliminates dependency on GitHub availability during builds",
        "Follows Rust and Node.js ecosystem best practices",
        "Enables automatic security scanning tools to detect vulnerable dependencies",
        "Reduces build times by using pre-built packages instead of compiling from source"
      ],
      "trade_offs": [
        "Pro: Stable, reproducible builds",
        "Pro: Better security posture with vulnerability scanning",
        "Pro: Faster builds (no git cloning, pre-compiled crates)",
        "Con: Must wait for official releases instead of using bleeding-edge features",
        "Con: Cannot easily test unreleased bug fixes (resolved: stable releases are now available)"

      "trade_offs": [
        "Pro: Guaranteed type safety and API stability",
        "Pro: Better IDE support with stable type definitions",
        "Pro: Matches Tauri v2 stable type system",
        "Con: Must regenerate bindings after upgrade (one-time cost)",

        "Reduces risk by catching issues early in controlled test environment",

        "Reduces blast radius if issues are discovered during upgrade",
        "Easier to identify root cause of problems (isolated to specific phase)",
