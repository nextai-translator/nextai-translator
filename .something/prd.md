# Add Homepage - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Problem Statement**
nextai translator currently lacks a centralized homepage or landing interface that welcomes users, provides quick access to core features, and offers an intuitive entry point into the application. Users are immediately directed to specific functionality without context or navigation options, which can create confusion for new users and limit discoverability of features.

**Proposed Solution**
Implement a homepage interface that serves as the primary entry point for the application, providing an overview of capabilities, quick access to translation/polishing/summarization features, recent activity, and navigation to settings and vocabulary management.

**Expected Impact**
- Improved user onboarding experience for new users
- Better feature discoverability through centralized navigation
- Enhanced user engagement through quick-access shortcuts
- Consistent user experience across desktop and browser extension platforms

**Success Metrics**
- Homepage successfully implements across both Tauri desktop app and browser extension
- Users can access all core features (translate, polish, summarize) from homepage
- Navigation to settings and vocabulary features is functional
- Initial load time remains under 1 second

## Technical Considerations

### Integration with Existing Architecture

**Shared Component Layer**
The homepage will be implemented as a new component in `src/common/components/` to ensure code reuse across platforms:
- `HomePage.tsx` - Main homepage component with quick actions and navigation
- `QuickActionCard.tsx` - Reusable card component for feature shortcuts
- `RecentActivityList.tsx` - Component for displaying recent translation history

**Platform-Specific Integration**
- **Desktop (Tauri)**: Add `HomeWindow.tsx` in `src/tauri/windows/` or integrate into existing `App.tsx` routing
- **Browser Extension**: Integrate homepage into extension popup (`src/browser-extension/popup/`) or create dedicated tab

**State Management Integration**
Leverage existing Jotai atoms and Zustand stores for:
- Recent activity tracking and retrieval
- User preference storage (default languages, visibility settings)
- Navigation state management between homepage and feature views

### UI Framework Consistency

The homepage will utilize existing BaseUI components and Styletron styling:
- Card components for quick action layout
- Button components following existing design system
- Typography and spacing consistent with current Settings and Translator windows
- Theme support for existing light/dark mode functionality

### Data Persistence

Recent activity data will be stored using:
- **Desktop**: Existing Tauri storage mechanisms via Rust backend
- **Browser**: Chrome storage API or IndexedDB (Dexie) as currently used
- Maximum 50 recent items stored, with FIFO eviction policy

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of recent activity to prevent blocking initial render
- Virtualization for long lists using react-window (already in dependencies)
- Memoization of quick action components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Preloading critical assets during application startup

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing translation/polishing/summarization services must remain functional
- i18next internationalization framework for all text strings
- BaseUI + Styletron design system for consistent styling
- Jotai/Zustand state management integration
- Existing storage mechanisms (Dexie for browser, Tauri storage for desktop)

### Technical Assumptions
1. No changes to LLM provider integration or API communication layer
2. Existing routing/navigation patterns can accommodate homepage integration
3. Current build process (Vite multi-config) supports adding new components
4. BaseUI components provide sufficient primitives for homepage layout
5. No backend API changes required - all data available locally

### Resource Requirements
- Frontend development: Component implementation, styling, integration testing
- Testing: Unit tests, E2E tests for navigation flows
- Design: UI/UX alignment with existing patterns (minimal design work)
- Documentation: Usage guide updates, developer documentation

## Risk Assessment

### User Experience Risks

**Risk: Homepage adds friction to quick workflows**
*Impact: Medium* | *Likelihood: Low*
- **Mitigation**: Provide keyboard shortcuts to bypass homepage and jump directly to translation
- **Mitigation**: Allow users to set default landing page (homepage vs. translator)

**Risk: Information overload on homepage**
*Impact: Low* | *Likelihood: Medium*
- **Mitigation**: Keep homepage focused on 3 core actions (translate, polish, summarize)
- **Mitigation**: Use progressive disclosure for advanced features

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Performance degradation from additional rendering**
*Impact: Medium* | *Likelihood: Low*
- **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting for homepage
- **Mitigation**: Profile and optimize render performance during development
- **Mitigation**: Establish performance budgets (< 1s load time)

**Risk: State management complexity**
*Impact: Low* | *Likelihood: Medium*
- **Mitigation**: Leverage existing Jotai/Zustand patterns without introducing new paradigms
- **Mitigation**: Keep homepage state isolated from feature-specific state

**Risk: Cross-platform inconsistencies**
*Impact: Medium* | *Likelihood: Medium*
- **Mitigation**: Develop homepage in shared `src/common/` layer first
- **Mitigation**: Test on all platforms early and continuously
- **Mitigation**: Use platform-specific wrappers only for necessary platform APIs
