## Technical Considerations

### High-Level Technical Approach

**Website Architecture**:
- **Recommended Stack**: Static Site Generator (SSG) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR) framework
  - **Option 1**: Next.js (React-based, aligns with product's React stack, excellent SEO)
  - **Option 2**: Astro (performance-focused, multi-framework support, optimal for content sites)
  - **Option 3**: SvelteKit (modern, fast, good developer experience)
  - **Option 4**: Docusaurus (if documentation is the primary focus)

**Technology Alignment**:
- Leverage React ecosystem knowledge since product uses React 18 + TypeScript
- Consider reusing UI components from BaseUI if visual consistency desired
- Utilize i18next for internationalization (same library as product)
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainer familiarity

**Content Management**:
- **Option 1**: File-based (Markdown/MDX) for simple content management
- **Option 2**: Headless CMS (Strapi, Contentful, Sanity) if non-technical content editors needed
- **Option 3**: Hybrid approach - static pages + CMS for blog/news

### Integration Points

**INT-1: GitHub Integration**
- Fetch real-time GitHub stars count via GitHub API
- Display latest release version and release notes
- Link to repository, issues, and discussions

**INT-2: Download Links**
