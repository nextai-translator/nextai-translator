## Test Data

### Test IDs Convention

All tests use `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection:

```tsx
// Example usage in components
<button data-testid="hero-primary-cta">Download</button>
<section data-testid="features-section">...</section>
<div data-testid="platform-option-windows">Windows</div>
```

### Common Test IDs

#### Homepage
- `hero-headline` - Main headline
- `hero-primary-cta` - Primary download button
- `hero-secondary-cta` - Secondary CTA
- `platform-indicators` - Platform badges
- `features-section` - Features section
- `feature-card` - Individual feature card
- `platform-showcase` - Platform showcase section

#### Navigation
- `main-header` - Site header
- `site-logo` - Logo link
- `language-selector` - Language switcher
- `mobile-menu-button` - Mobile menu toggle
- `main-footer` - Site footer

#### Download Page
- `platform-selector` - Platform tabs/selector
- `platform-option-{platform}` - Platform option (e.g., `platform-option-windows`)
- `download-{platform}-{format}` - Download link (e.g., `download-windows-exe`)
- `{platform}-requirements` - System requirements
- `{platform}-instructions` - Installation instructions

#### Documentation
- `docs-sidebar` - Documentation sidebar
- `docs-content` - Main documentation content
- `docs-search` - Documentation search
- `table-of-contents` - Page TOC
- `breadcrumbs` - Breadcrumb navigation

## Expected Failures

Since this is TDD RED PHASE, all tests are expected to fail with errors like:

- `locator.toBeVisible: Error: Target closed`
- `expect.toBeVisible: Timeout exceeded`
- `404 Not Found`
- Missing elements with specified test IDs

This is **normal and expected** until the website is implemented.

## Contributing

When implementing features:

1. Read the corresponding test file to understand requirements
